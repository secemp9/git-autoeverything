# git-autoeverything
Git autocommit &amp; autosync script

This is the start of a bigger project. For now this only support autocommit and autosync (across two directories only for now).

# Usage

```bash
./git-auto.sh "/first/path /second/path"
```

# TODO:

- Support for more features
- Support More directories for the autosync feature
- Make use of the autocommit across multiple repos
- Add watchman and inotify wait as alternative (given this only use git for now, which is good enough for small project)
- ???
